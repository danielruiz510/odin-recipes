<h2>The Lasagna Dish Just Like Mama Use To Make</h2>

<p>This lasagna dish brings back fond memories for me.  Growing up my mother and grandmother made sure to make this atleast twice a month, usually for Sunday lunch. While there are many lasagna recipes out there this one is all done from scratch.</p>

<p>Everything from the sauce to the pasta sheets are done by hand.  I know what you're thinking...Isn't this dish going to take to long? While the finished product will take you about an extra hour, I promise you it is well worth it.</p>
