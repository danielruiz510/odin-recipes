    <li>½ cup ketchup</li>

    <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
    
    <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pork Chop Cooking Direction</h3>

<p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make these incredible Pork Chops:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Heat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze.</li>
    <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
